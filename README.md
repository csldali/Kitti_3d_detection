# Kitti_3d_detection

**Tools and instructions for understanding, loading and visualizing the 3D detection data from the KITTI Vision Benchmark (http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).**
The code was implemented using python 3.6


Currently in this repository is a Jupyter Notebook (kittiLoader.ipynb) with detailed instruction on how to:
 - Load 
 - Visualize 
 - Manipulate 
 The data from the 3D detection benchmark. 
 
 *Forgive the pure English level, some impovements may come shortly*
 
 Future Tasks: 
  -  Gather all the function provided in the jupyter notebook and organise them to create a python package. Also, a jupyter demo on how to use this package to import and use the implemented functions/classes.
